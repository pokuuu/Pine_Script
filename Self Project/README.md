# MomentumBreaker Strategy

This script creates a trading strategy called "MomentumBreaker" using Pine Script in TradingView. The strategy identifies potential buying and selling opportunities based on calculated slopes of the closing price.

## Indicators and Parameters

- **Closing Price**: Represents the closing price of the asset.

- **Periods**: Four periods (`period_1`, `period_2`, `period_3`, `period_4`) are used to calculate slopes for momentum analysis. These periods can be adjusted as needed.

## Slope Calculation

The `calculate_slope` function computes the slope of a linear regression line over a specified period. This slope indicates the momentum of price movement.

## Weights

- Four weights (`weight_1`, `weight_2`, `weight_3`, `weight_4`) allow assigning importance to calculated slopes.

## Combined Slope

The combined slope is calculated by aggregating the weighted average of individual slopes, indicating overall momentum based on selected periods and weights.

## Plots

The script plots individual slopes and the combined slope. Line colors (`green` for upward, `red` for downward) indicate slope direction.

## Strategy Entries

1. **Buy Signal**: Generated when the combined slope is greater than its previous value. Suggests positive momentum shift, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. Long entry with quantity of 10.

2. **Sell Signal**: Generated when combined slope is less than its previous value. Suggests negative momentum shift, potentially indicating a selling opportunity. Short entry with quantity of 1.

## Usage

Apply the script to a TradingView chart. Adjust parameters to fine-tune strategy sensitivity. Remember, this is a basic example and needs further optimization before actual use.

**Note**: Trading carries risks. This script serves as a starting point for research and isn't financial advice.
